# Task Reflection: Registration and Authentication System (CQST-001)

**Task ID:** CQST-001  
**Complexity Level:** 3 (Intermediate Feature)  
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-25  
**Duration:** ~1 day (planning + implementation + testing)

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete JWT-based authentication system for the CityQuest MVP following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The implementation includes REST API endpoints for user registration and login with comprehensive validation, testing, and code quality assurance. The system is production-ready with CI/CD documentation for secure deployment.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 3 REST API endpoints (register, login, logout)
- Complete DDD architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation layers)
- 25 automated tests (12 Unit + 13 Integration) with 100% pass rate
- CI/CD documentation for JWT key management in production
- Database migration with UUID-based schema

---

## What Went Well

### âœ… Architecture & Design
- **DDD Structure:** Clean separation of concerns across all layers made the codebase highly maintainable and testable
- **UUID Primary Keys:** Decision to use UUIDs instead of auto-increment integers provides better scalability and security
- **Domain Exceptions:** Custom exceptions (UserAlreadyExistsException, InvalidCredentialsException) improved error handling and API responses
- **DTO Pattern:** RegisterUserRequest DTO with validation attributes centralized input validation logic

### âœ… Technology Stack
- **LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle:** Seamless integration with Symfony Security, minimal configuration required
- **Doctrine ORM:** UUID type support worked flawlessly, migrations handled schema changes smoothly
- **Symfony Validator:** Attribute-based validation reduced boilerplate code significantly

### âœ… Testing Approach
- **Test-First Implementation:** Writing integration tests early helped catch API contract issues before they became problems
- **Separate Test Database:** Using \`cityquest_test\` database isolated tests from development data
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** 25 tests covering happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios provided confidence in the implementation

### âœ… Documentation
- **CI/CD Guide:** Proactive documentation of JWT key generation and rotation for production prevents security issues
- **Init-DB Sync Rule:** Added mandatory rule in IMPLEMENT MODE about syncing migrations with init-db script prevents deployment issues

## Challenges

### ðŸ”§ Challenge 1: Database Schema Migration Conflicts
**Problem:** Initial migration attempted to ALTER an existing table with int ID, but we needed to CREATE a new table with UUID from scratch.

**Resolution:** 
- Deleted conflicting migration file
- Manually rewrote migration to use \`CREATE TABLE\` instead of \`ALTER TABLE\`
- Dropped and recreated database schema for clean slate

**Lesson:** When making fundamental schema changes (data type of primary key), it's often cleaner to recreate tables rather than migrate existing data during MVP development.

### ðŸ”§ Challenge 2: JWT Token User Identifier
**Problem:** Initial JWT tokens contained \`username\` as identifier, but our system uses \`email\` as the unique identifier. This caused authentication failures.

**Resolution:**
- Corrected configuration in \`lexik_jwt_authentication.yaml\` with \`user_id_claim: email\`
- Updated \`security.yaml\` to use \`email\` property in user provider

**Lesson:** Always verify JWT token contents match your authentication strategy. The user identifier in tokens must match what your security system expects.

### ðŸ”§ Challenge 3: Web Form vs REST API Confusion
**Problem:** Initial implementation mixed web form login controllers with REST API endpoints, creating routing conflicts and unclear architecture.

**Resolution:**
- Removed all web form implementations (LoginController, RegistrationController, templates)
- Removed Security authenticators for form login
- Cleaned \`security.yaml\` to only include JWT-based firewalls
- Removed Web Profiler and Debug routes for production-ready API

**Lesson:** For REST API projects, commit to the architecture early and remove conflicting patterns. Mixing authentication strategies adds unnecessary complexity.

### ðŸ”§ Challenge 4: Integration Test Database Management
**Problem:** Tests initially failed due to database state persistence between test runs, causing duplicate key violations.

**Resolution:**
- Created dedicated test database (\`cityquest_test\`)
- Added manual \`TRUNCATE TABLE users CASCADE\` before test runs
- Applied migrations to test database

**Lesson:** Integration tests need clean database state. Consider using database transactions or fixtures for better test isolation in future.

## Lessons Learned

### ðŸ“š Technical Lessons

1. **UUID in Doctrine:** Using \`#[ORM\\Column(type: 'uuid')]\` with \`Symfony\\Component\\Uid\\Uuid\` works seamlessly. Remember to add \`COMMENT ON COLUMN\` for Doctrine type hints in migrations.

2. **JWT Configuration:** The \`user_id_claim\` parameter in LexikJWT configuration is critical. It determines what field from the User entity becomes the JWT subject claim.

3. **Repository Pattern:** Having both an interface (\`UserRepositoryInterface\`) and implementation (\`DoctrineUserRepository\`) paid off immediately during testing - we can easily mock the repository.

4. **Validation Attributes:** PHP 8 attributes for validation (\`#[Assert\\Email]\`, \`#[Assert\\Length]\`) are more readable and maintainable than YAML or XML configuration.

5. **Integration Testing in Symfony:** \`WebTestCase\` provides excellent tools for testing API endpoints. The \`static::createClient()\` pattern handles kernel booting and request simulation effectively.

### ðŸ“š Process Lessons

1. **Technology Validation First:** Spending time upfront to validate JWT setup, generate keys, and test authentication prevented late-stage surprises.

2. **Documentation as You Go:** Creating \`ci-cd.md\` during implementation (not after) ensured we captured critical deployment knowledge while it was fresh.

3. **Code Quality Tools Early:** Running PHPStan and PHP-CS-Fixer during development (not just at the end) caught issues when they were easier to fix.

4. **Migration Strategy:** For new projects, creating init-db scripts alongside migrations provides a safety net for fresh installations.

## Process Improvements

### ðŸ”„ For Future Level 3 Tasks:

1. **Test Database Automation:** Create a Makefile command or composer script for test database setup:
   \`\`\`bash
   make test-db-reset
   # Should: create test DB, run migrations, truncate tables
   \`\`\`

2. **Integration Test Base Class:** Create \`ApiTestCase\` extending \`WebTestCase\` with:
   - Automatic database cleanup in \`setUp()\`/\`tearDown()\`
   - Helper methods for authenticated requests
   - JSON assertion helpers

3. **Migration Checklist:** Add pre-commit hook or CI check to verify:
   - Every Doctrine migration has corresponding update in \`init-db/cityquest.sql\`
   - Migration can run on empty database

4. **Security Configuration Validation:** Add automated test to verify:
   - JWT endpoints return proper status codes
   - Protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
   - Access control rules work as expected

---

## Technical Improvements

### ðŸ’¡ Architecture Enhancements:

1. **Refresh Token Strategy:** Current implementation uses only access tokens. Consider adding refresh tokens for better security:
   \`\`\`
   - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) 
   - Refresh endpoint to exchange tokens
   \`\`\`

2. **Email Verification:** Add email verification flow for production:
   \`\`\`
   - Generate verification token on registration
   - Send verification email
   - Verify endpoint to activate account
   - Prevent login until verified
   \`\`\`

3. **Password Reset:** Implement password reset functionality:
   \`\`\`
   - Request reset endpoint
   - Token-based reset link
   - Password update endpoint
   \`\`\`

4. **Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks:
   \`\`\`
   - Use Symfony Rate Limiter component
   - Limit login attempts per IP
   - Exponential backoff on failures
   \`\`\`

### ðŸ’¡ Testing Enhancements:

1. **Test Fixtures:** Use \`DoctrineFixturesBundle\` for consistent test data

2. **API Test Assertions:** Create custom assertions for common patterns

3. **Test Coverage Reporting:** Configure PHPUnit code coverage
